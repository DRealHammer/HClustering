here we always use nodecount, edgecount and graphlets

actually no other metric could significantly improve the error rates

so the currently useful features are:

Node count
edge count
graphlets


possible critic points are, that the used dataset is rather small
maybe something could be learned from a bigger dataset

also using the node and edge count does not provide any improvement of the error
possible further options would be:
processing of the graphlets using
- nodecount or edgecount 
- global graphlet statistics
